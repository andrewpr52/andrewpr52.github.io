TODO:

	Videos
		-Modify page to dynamically load videos as the user scrolls. Currently, all videos load right away.
		-Properly implement buttons to sort all videos either Alphabetically or by their Upload Date to YouTube.

	Original Music
		-Modify the page to dynamically load videos as the user scrolls - similarly to the "Videos" page.

	Contact
		-Properly implement the contact form's "Submit" button. Currently, clicking the button does not send the form and redirects to a 404.
		-Prevent contact form from becoming too narrow when the browser is resized smaller.
